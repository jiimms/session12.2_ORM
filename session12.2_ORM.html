ORM: Object-relational mapping (ORM) is a mechanism that makes it
possible to address, access and manipulate objects between incompatible
type systems in object-oriented programming languages.

This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.

ORM lets programmers maintain a consistent view of objects over time, even as the sources and the applications that access them change.
